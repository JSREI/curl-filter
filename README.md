## üéØ Problem Solved

When you copy a request as cURL from Chrome DevTools (or other browsers), it includes many default headers and parameters that you might not need:

- Unnecessary headers like `User-Agent`, `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding`, etc.
- Browser-specific headers like `sec-ch-ua`, `sec-fetch-*` headers
- Authentication cookies that shouldn't be shared
- Redundant query parameters

This tool helps you clean up these cURL commands by applying configurable filtering rules.

## üîß Use Cases

- **API Testing Tools**: Clean cURL commands before importing into Postman, Apifox, Insomnia
- **Coze Plugin Development**: Prepare clean API requests for plugin configuration
- **Documentation**: Generate clean cURL examples for API documentation
- **Security**: Remove sensitive headers and cookies from shared cURL commands
- **Automation**: Standardize cURL commands for scripts and CI/CD pipelines

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Filtering**: Remove unwanted headers, query parameters, and form data
- **Configurable Rules**: Create custom filtering rules with regex patterns
- **Real-time Preview**: See filtering results as you type
- **History Management**: Keep track of your filtering history
- **Export/Import**: Save and share your filtering rules
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
